abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of mass-market consumer software that takes inspiration from video games. Usually summarized as "gamification", this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how "gamification" relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate "gamification" and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that "gamified" applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of "gamification" as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.},

abstract={Gamification is the use of elements and techniques from video game design in non-game contexts. Amid the rapid growth of this practice, normative questions have been under-explored. The primary goal of this article is to develop a normatively sophisticated and descriptively rich account for appropriately addressing major ethical considerations associated with gamification. The framework suggests that practitioners and designers should be precautious about, primarily, but not limited to, whether or not their use of gamification practices: (1) takes unfair advantage of workers (e.g., exploitation); (2) infringes any involved workers' or customers' autonomy (e.g., manipulation); (3) intentionally or unintentionally harms workers and other involved parties; or (4) has a negative effect on the moral character of involved parties.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of game-like elements is become increasingly popular in the context of fitness and health apps. While such “gamified” apps hold great potential in motivating people to improve their health, they also come with a “darker side”. Recent work suggests that these gamified health apps raise a number of ethical challenges that, if left unaddressed, are not only morally problematic but also have adverse effects on user health and engagement with the apps. However, studies highlighting the ethical challenges of gamification have also met with criticism, indicating that they fall short of providing guidance to practitioners. In avoiding this mistake, this paper seeks to advance the goal of facilitating a practice-relevant guide for designers of gamified health apps to address ethical issues raised by use of such apps. More specifically, the paper seeks to achieve two major aims: (a) to propose a revised practice-relevant theoretical framework that outlines the responsibilities of the designers of gamified health apps, and (b) to provide a landscape of the various ethical issues related to gamified health apps based on a systematic literature review of the empirical literature investigating adverse effects of such apps.},

In Spain, this disease is suffered by 62% of the population, leading to the emergence of new health problems. Increasing childhood obesity in the world is a direct result of changes in the lifestyles of the population. Therefore, in this paper we present a gamification training program to prevent childhood obesity based on motor games, and active videogames developed for overweight children ages 8–12. The design of the program consisted of: group sessions in a school setting, individual sessions at home for the children, and developing healthy habits to help families. The motivation and the effectiveness of the gamification training program were studied. The results involving biometric variables, learning healthy habits and experience in the intervention were highly satisfactory.}

abstract = {Abstract Medical education is changing at a fast pace. Students attend medical school with a high degree of technological literacy and a desire for a diverse educational experience. As a result, a growing number of medical schools are incorporating technology-enhanced active learning and multimedia education tools into their curriculum. Gamified training platforms include educational games, mobile medical apps, and virtual patient scenarios. We provide a systematic review of what is meant by gamification in this era. Specific educational games, mobile apps, and virtual simulations that may be used for preclinical and clinical training have been discovered and classified. The available data were presented in terms of the recognized platforms for medical education's possible benefits. Virtual patient simulations have been shown to enhance learning results in general. Gamification could improve learning, engagement, and cooperation by allowing for real-world application. They may also help with promoting risk-free healthcare decision-making, remote learning, learning analytics, and quick feedback. We account for Preclinical training which included 5 electronic games and 4 mobile apps, while clinical training included 5 electronic games, 10 mobile applications, and 12 virtual patient simulation tools. There were additionally nine more gamified virtual environment training products that were not commercially accessible. Many of these studies have shown that utilizing gamified media in medical education may confer advantages. This collection of hyperlinked resources may be utilized by medical students, practitioners, and instructors at all levels.},

ABSTRACT = {Gamification, the use of game design elements in applications that are not games, has been developed to provide attractive environments and maintain user interest in several domains. In domains such as education, marketing and health, where gamification techniques are applied, user engagement in applications has increased. In these applications the protection of users&rsquo; privacy is an important aspect to consider, due to the applications obtaining a record of the personal information of their users. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to identify if applications where gamification is applied do respect users&rsquo; privacy. For the accomplishment of this aim, two main steps have been implemented. Since the main principle of gamification is the existence of game elements, the first step was to identify the set of game elements recorded in the literature that are commonly applied in various applications. Afterwards, an examination of the relationship between these elements and privacy requirements was implemented in order to identify which elements conflict with the privacy requirements leading to potential privacy violations and which elements do not. &Alpha; conceptual model according to the results of this examination was designed, which presents how elements conflict with requirements. Based on the results, there are indeed game elements which can lead to privacy violations. The results of this work provide valuable guidance to software developers, especially during the design stages of gamified applications since it helps them to consider the protection of users&rsquo; privacy in parallel from the early stages of the application development onwards.},
